Brainstorming
- Access through room "Corridors of Proof" where you prove you have all four elements. Vertical hallways (all in one room) like a snake for each element.
- Floors "U1" and counting down
- First room "Entry Test" has those pillars which react to all four elements, somehow unlocks the room by providing a respective element's puzzle element. (ice provides bubble)
- Second room is the corridor of proof, the entry test should just be a simple four element pole test with spawning switches.
- Then you just make puzzles with whatever you want.

corridor: "Suspicious Corridor"
entrance: "Entry Trial"
corridor 2: "Corridor of Proof"
???: "Trial of Convolution" (old entrance)

Entry Trial will involve using the pillars at different angles to move throughout the room at different heights.
